## 😷🦠Inspiration
Ensuring that everyone has the ability to book a COVID-19 vaccine is important, now more than ever.
The process of booking a vaccine through pharmacies can be long and tedious, as users must navigate to *each* individual pharmacy site to view availability. Regardless of organizations such as Vaccine Hunters Canada which aid eligible Canadians in finding vaccines, finding a spot to a vaccination appointment locally is still almost impossible. Our project, VaxAlert, aims to address this by allowing users the opportunity to select a location and receive a text message notification when any pharmacy in that region has available vaccine times.

## 💉 What it does
The premise of our project is based around a user-friendly, responsive webpage where visitors can enter their contact information, needed vaccine type, and location. While storing this information, a web scraping program would be used to flag when vaccine appointments become available on a pharmacy website. Based on the collected information, a notification will then be sent to the appropriate people by text. This eliminates the burden of constantly checking several different pharmacy websites and signing up for dozens of waitlists individually, allowing the community to become better protected from the pandemic.
